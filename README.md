# World Cup Goals Analysis Dashboard

This application is a portfolio project built using Plotly's Dash , faculty.ai's Dash Bootstrap Components, and Pandas. Using historical FIFA World Cup data, this Dash app provides visualizations for goals statistics dating from 1986 to 2022.

## The Analysis

This dashboard aims to explore the following:
 - Fulltime Total Goals
 - Halftime Total Goals
 - Which half has more goals?
 - Do both teams score?

Users can filter these goal stats by year and by stage _(eg. Group stage, Semi-finals, etc)_.
